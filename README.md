The GhostRTC tool is designed to detect potential IP address leaks caused by WebRTC in modern browsers. WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) can inadvertently expose your real IP addressâ€”even when using a VPNâ€”posing a threat to your online anonymity. This tool simulates a leak scenario by initiating a WebRTC connection and capturing any IP addresses exposed during the negotiation process.


# ðŸ”§ Use Cases:
## Penetration testing and privacy audits

- VPN configuration testing

- Browser anonymity verification

- Automated privacy compliance checks

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/webdragon63/GhostRTC.git
cd GhostRTC
```
After the installation just run the WebRTC.sh tool -->>`bash WebRTC.sh` for Checking WebRTC leaks and the solutions.

### ***If the leaks persists then you see an output of leak and the solution on your terminal***
